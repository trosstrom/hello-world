#Hello-World

Hey there!

My name is Troy. I'm 28 years old and have struggled with mental health and substance abuse for a good part of my life. Fortunately, my life has changed dramatically. I am clean and sober now. With a clear, vision of my purpose in life. To help others, who are in need of help but due to many reasons. Are unable to find the proper help they need. Well, I believe I may have an idea that could help many many people, as well as their families. So I have decided to devote as much time as possible, to make my idea a reality. And since my idea is mainly through online networks. I have decided to learn how to become a Front-End web developer. So that I have a clear understanding and physical input, on my project. So I am taking online courses, watching youtube tutorials and reading textbooks.. Day in and Day out. Trying to learn as much and as fast as possible. To make my dream a reality. Plus, a big bonus finding out that I really enjoy coding!
